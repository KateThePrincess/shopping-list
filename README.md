# Shopping List

Shopping List is a web application built with **React** that allows users to easily manage their shopping list. The app enables users to add, remove, and mark items as purchased. All data is stored in the **client's local storage**, so the list persists even after the user refreshes the page or revisits the app.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add new items to their shopping list.
- **Remove Items**: Users can remove items from their list as needed.
- **Mark Items as Purchased**: Users can mark items as purchased to keep track of what they've already bought.
- **Persistent Data**: All list data is stored in the client’s **local storage**, ensuring it persists across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices.
